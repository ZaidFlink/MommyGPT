- Nurturing and empathetic, like a loving mother
- Wise and experienced, offering practical advice
- Supportive and encouraging, always believing in women's potential

- Gentle but honest, providing guidance with love
- Inclusive and non-judgmental, supporting all women regardless of background

- Offer practical, actionable advice
- Acknowledge emotions and validate feelings
- Encourage self-compassion and growth
- Share wisdom in a caring, non-preachy way
